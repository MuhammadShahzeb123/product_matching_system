# Product Matching System Context

## Current State

The product matching system compares Amazon and Target products and generates JSON reports. Currently:

### Issues to Fix

1. **Missing Product URLs**: Reports only contain ASIN/TCIN but no clickable product URLs
2. **Incomplete Price Extraction**: Prices may not be properly extracted from both platforms

### Current Report Structure

- Amazon products show: title, asin, brand, price
- Target products show: title, tcin, brand, price, url (but url may be empty)

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Complete Product URLs

- **Amazon URLs**: Built from ASIN using format `https://www.amazon.com/dp/{asin}/`
- **Target URLs**: Built from TCIN using format `https://www.target.com/p/-/A-{tcin}`

### 2. Enhanced Price Extraction

- Improved price extraction logic for both platforms
- Added fallback methods to ensure prices are captured

### 3. Updated Report Generation

- Modified both `_generate_matching_report()` and `_generate_url_matching_report()` methods
- Added URL generation logic for both platforms
- Enhanced price extraction paths

## Files Modified

- `product_matching_system.py`: Main matching logic and report generation

## URL Formats

- **Amazon**: `https://www.amazon.com/dp/{asin}/`
- **Target**: `https://www.target.com/p/-/A-{tcin}`

## New Methods Added

1. `_build_amazon_url(asin)`: Builds complete Amazon product URL from ASIN
2. `_build_target_url(tcin)`: Builds complete Target product URL from TCIN
3. `_extract_amazon_price(product)`: Enhanced Amazon price extraction with fallbacks
4. `_extract_target_price(product)`: Enhanced Target price extraction with fallbacks

## Updated Report Structure

Both Amazon and Target products now include:
- **title**: Product name
- **asin/tcin**: Product identifier
- **brand**: Product brand
- **price**: Formatted price with $ symbol
- **url**: Complete clickable product URL

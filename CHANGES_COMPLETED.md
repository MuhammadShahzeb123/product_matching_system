- `_load_sample_target_product_details()` method - **COMPLETELY REMOVED**
- All `allow_sample_fallback` parameters - **REMOVED**
- All fallback logic to local JSON files - **REMOVED**
- All references to "sample data", "demonstration", "pre-downloaded products" - **REMOVED**

**Updated methods:**
- `_search_target_products()` - Now only does live Target.com search
- `_search_target_products_intelligently()` - Removed sample fallback calls
- `run_amazon_url_matching_workflow()` - Removed sample data logic

**Result:** System now **ONLY** searches Target.com live - no local file fallbacks whatsoever.

### 2. üéØ **IMPLEMENTED ENHANCED SELLER & SHIPMENT EXTRACTION**

**New methods added:**
- `_extract_enhanced_seller_shipment_info()` - Main extraction method with regex patterns
- `_clean_seller_name()` - Cleans extracted seller/shipper names

**Regex patterns implemented (exactly as requested):**
- `"Sold by * and Shipped by *"` - **PRIMARY PATTERN** (as requested)
- `"Ships from and sold by *"` - Alternative pattern
- `"Sold by *"` - Seller-only pattern
- `"Shipped by *"` - Shipper-only pattern
- `"Ships from *"` - Alternative shipper pattern

**Intelligent shipment detection:**
- If `shipped by` contains "amazon" ‚Üí `"Shipped by Amazon"`
- If `shipped by` is NOT amazon ‚Üí `"Shipped by Seller"` (as requested)

**Data sources searched:**
- `fulfillment_text`, `seller_info`, `shipping_info`, `delivery_info`
- `pricing.seller_info`, `details.seller_info`, `specifications.seller_info`
- `raw_html`, `description` (if available)

### 3. üìä **ENHANCED REPORTING WITH SELLER/SHIPMENT INFO**

**Updated report methods:**
- `_generate_url_matching_report()` - Shows seller & shipment details
- `_generate_matching_report()` - Shows enhanced fulfillment info

**Display format:**
```
üöö SELLER & SHIPMENT INFO:
   üè™ Sold by: MilleLoom
   üì¶ Shipped by: Amazon
   üöõ Shipment type: Shipped by Amazon
   üîç Extracted from: 'Sold by MilleLoom and Shipped by Amazon'
```

### 4. üßπ **CLEANED UP MARKETPLACE INFO EXTRACTION**

**Enhanced `_extract_amazon_marketplace_info()` method:**
- Added `enhanced_fulfillment` section with regex-extracted data
- Maintained existing fulfillment info for compatibility
- Added clean seller name processing

## üéØ EXACT USER REQUIREMENTS FULFILLED

### ‚úÖ "Remove the system of falling back to files stored on the local system"
- **DONE**: All sample data fallback methods completely removed

- **DONE**: System fails cleanly if Target search unavailable (no sample fallbacks)

### ‚úÖ "Get info of who is selling the product and who is making the shipment"
- **DONE**: Implemented comprehensive seller/shipment extraction
- **DONE**: Uses regex patterns to extract from product text
- **DONE**: Handles multiple text sources (fulfillment_text, seller_info, etc.)

### ‚úÖ "Apply regex filter like 'Sold by * and Shipped by *'"
- **DONE**: Primary regex pattern `'Sold by * and Shipped by *'` implemented

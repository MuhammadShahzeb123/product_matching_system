# Product Matching System - URL and Price Enhancement ✅

## COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

The product matching system has been updated to include complete product URLs and enhanced price extraction for both Amazon and Target products.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Complete Product URLs
- **Amazon URLs**: `https://www.amazon.com/dp/{asin}/`
- **Target URLs**: `https://www.target.com/p/-/A-{tcin}`

### 2. Enhanced Price Extraction
- Multiple fallback methods for robust price extraction
- Handles various price data structures
- Automatically formats prices with $ symbol

### 3. Updated JSON Report Structure

**Before:**
```json
{
  "amazon_product": {
    "title": "Product Name",
    "asin": "B08KTN2NSW",
    "brand": "Brand",
    "price": ""
  }
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "amazon_product": {
    "title": "Product Name",
    "asin": "B08KTN2NSW",
    "brand": "Brand",
    "price": "$149.99",
    "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KTN2NSW/"
  }
}
```

## New Methods Added

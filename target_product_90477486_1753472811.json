This cooler was pre-chilled per the directions and sits inside of his truck not exposed to any sunlight. We put in 2 large bags of ice and within 2 days or less the ice has pretty much melted, so we are buying ice way more than what I thought this cooler was capable of. The cooler has sweated so much the entire time we’ve used it, it has soaked the backseat of my husbands truck. We’ve checked the drain plugs to ensure they are screwed on tight but it still sweats a lot. This has been a not so great first experience with a cooler but maybe we are doing something wrong? The good things about it is the size. It’s big enough to hold a good amount of drinks with ice. I like the color and the bottle opener can be useful too.",

It was also in a car without a/c in 80 degree weather, so it was blisteringly hot, but the ice still didn't melt for several hours. No leak, lots of space, very durable. Held food for two people to last 3 days. Wasn't even completely full. A little heavy, but handles are nicely constructed so carrying isn't a terrible ordeal. Lid closes very effectively and very well sealed. Interesting construction with a \"rubber\" latch to create an airtight seal. It's nice that it doesn't need to be \"snapped\" shut, I feel like it's more accessible that way, and probably easier. Design is very nice, the blue color is very pleasing on the eyes.",
